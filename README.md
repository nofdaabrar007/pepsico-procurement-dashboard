2.  **Preview Headers (Optional but Recommended)**:
    -   After selecting a file, click the **"Preview Headers"** button.

3.  **Parse & Open Dashboard**:
    -   Click the **"Parse & Open Dashboard"** button.
    -   The application will process the file and automatically navigate you to the dashboard.

    -   **Search**: Use the search bar at the top to instantly find records across all fields.
    -   **Sort Table**: Click on any column header in the table to sort the data.
    -   **Toggle View**: Switch between the data table and the chart view using the icons in the top-right of the "Analysis" section.

## üåê Deployment on GitHub Pages (GUI Method)

You can host this application for free on GitHub Pages. Here‚Äôs how:

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1.  Log in to your GitHub account.
2.  Click the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., `procurement-dashboard`).
4.  Select **"Public"** (GitHub Pages for free accounts requires a public repository).
5.  Click **"Create repository"**.

#### Step 2: Upload Project Files

1.  On your new repository's page, click the **"Add file"** button and then **"Upload files"**.
2.  Open your project folder on your computer. It should have the following structure:
    ```
    your-project-folder/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts
    ```
3.  Drag and drop all of these files and folders into the GitHub upload window.
4.  Wait for the files to finish uploading, then add a commit message (e.g., "Initial commit") and click **"Commit changes"**.

#### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1.  In your repository, click on the **"Settings"** tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.
3.  Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**.
4.  Set the "Branch" to **`main`** and the folder to **`/ (root)`**.
5.  Click **"Save"**.

#### Step 4: Access Your Live App

-   Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and deploy your site.
-   A green banner will appear on the **Settings -> Pages** screen with your live URL. It will look like this:
    `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/`
-   Click the link to visit your live web application!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

-   **Parsing Errors**: If you see a "Failed to parse file" error, try re-saving your file as a fresh `.xlsx` in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. This often resolves issues with file corruption or unsupported legacy formats.
-   **No Data Found**: The app requires columns that can be mapped to **`poNumber`** and **`creationDate`**. If these are missing, rows will be skipped. Use the "Preview Headers" feature on the Upload page to ensure your key columns are being detected.
-   **Incorrect Header Detection**: The app scans the first 8 rows of each sheet to find the best header match. If your headers are located further down, the detection may fail. Please ensure headers are near the top of the sheet.
